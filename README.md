<h3>Myers-Briggs personality test</h3>
  <p>ISFJ:

My personality type test gauged me as an ISFJ which is described as someone who is  dependable, considerate and loyal to those closest to them. Having a firm grasp of the factual realities that lie before you as well as an eye for detail, each of which make you naturally gravitate towards others and their emotional needs. Nurturing and attentive, you tend to be quick to assume responsibility and to help out as soon as you see some task that could aid others. Conscientious, thorough, and perhaps a bit perfectionistic, you are not one to impulsively chase after new and uncertain prospects before having finished the endeavor at hand. You tend to find a deep sense of satisfaction in working hard to achieve your goals and in selflessly supporting others, demonstrating that you care through your actions and preferring to lead by your quiet, dignified example.<p>

  <H3>Whats your learning style?<H3>
    
You are a Visual/Tactile learner!My learning style gauged me as a visual and tactile learner, I lean by visually 
observing something and then having a hands on approach to it. I prefer to see and feel what it is I am learning. I learn   
quicker by seeing and doing. Visualisation is a huge part of learning before actually getting my hands on it. I often 
require frequent breaks while learning to thoroughly internalise what it is I am learning before getting back to it.

More extravert than introvert Your energy style is a blend of Introversion and Extraversion, and as such, you are 
neither a true Introvert nor a true Extravert.  For the purposes of personality typing, you may call yourself an 
Extravert, as you do tend slightly to prefer this mode. However, it’s more accurate to say that you are a bit of both 
Extravert and Introvert: you tend to use both styles somewhat equally, or you may prefer one style over the other 
depending on the situation.

  <H3>What these results mean to me?<H3>
    
These tests are very informative, but I am not too surprised with the results. These are things I already knew of for 
the most part and expected with my results. I however thought of myself more as an introvert with extrovert tendencies 
but the test said I was actually the opposite. This was surprising to me.

  <H3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?<H3>
    
Knowing who I am as a person and understanding my strengths and weaknesses enables me to effectively mesh with a team. 
I will understand just what I bring to the table, how I am able to effectively contribute to the team. I can also 
realise potential clashes in personalities before it occurs and work out just how best to mitigate it.
